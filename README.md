# Automation_of_downloading_50_files
Tools: Python, Selenium, Time, OS 

Automation of downloading 50 files to save my coleague's time - this is 1st part of project he had to do. I helped him. 

This program obtain downloading files from site, which was weekly task of my coleague and tooks a lot of time to get to all those links and download such ammount of files. I know that I could use some loop but this is my second program and it is very simple in its manner but works. I'm developing myself.

But of course please and bear in mind that this is code to use into my organization, and will not work on your computer because of no access. So you may just see the code of my work. You can see may work but please remember that this is just to see my work. This code will not work on your computer and I needed to modified the data.
